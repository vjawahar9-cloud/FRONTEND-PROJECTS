     <p>If Cricket is one of my favorite hobbies because it keeps me active, focused, and connected with my friends. Playing cricket helps me stay fit and improves my teamwork, patience, and decision-making skills. I enjoy both batting and bowling, and I often practice in my free time to improve my performance. Watching professional matches also inspires me to learn new techniques and understand the strategies used by top players. Cricket is not just a sport for me—it’s a passion that teaches discipline, sportsmanship, and the joy of working together toward a common goal.</p>
